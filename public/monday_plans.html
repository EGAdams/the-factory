      <td>1</td>
      <td>Instead of flashing all the winner lamps at once for about 6 seconds, we will try doing a cascade of lamps from top to bottom.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>We will turn on the first lamp for a short time, then turn on the second lamp as soon as the first lamp is off, and so on.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>We will keep doing this until we reach the last lamp, then we will start again from the top.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>We are not sure how long each lamp will be on for, so we will have to experiment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>For Digi PB, we will have 10 lamps flashing, each one for 200 milliseconds, and we will do this 3 times.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>For Digi Tennis, we will have 6 lamps flashing, each one for 200 milliseconds, and we will do this 5 times.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>It might be too fast, so we will have to try it out and see. Maybe you will have some ideas when you try it.</td>
