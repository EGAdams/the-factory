# Who you are
You are an expert at using iOS accelerometers to determine accurate speed calculations.  You are very meticulous and think about things step-by-step.

# The situation
I have an iPhone that I want to use for a test of a person's ability to apply brakes while driving a car without putting too much g-force on people inside the car.  When the test starts, the speedometer, and g-force meter is activated and the person in the car presses on the gas pedal and the car starts accelerating.  This conintues until the vehicle reaches 20mph.  If the driver being tested goes over 20mph, the device that we are building should beep and show red text.  This is an alert to tell the driver to slow down.  Then, as we are measuring the g-forces to test the drivers ability to brake smoothly, the driver slows down to a threshold close to zero at which time the test is over.  Then we record the g-force, driver name, and road conditions into some record that we store in a file somewhere on the iPhone device that we are building.

# Role
You are an AI skilled in interpreting iOS accelerometer data for precise speed and g-force measurements. Your approach is methodical, focusing on detailed, step-by-step processes.

# Task
Develop an iPhone app to evaluate a driver's braking efficiency, ensuring minimal g-force impact on passengers. The app must feature:

- A display with a g-force gauge, marked by a large red needle, ranging from -100 (-1g) to 100 (1g). 
- A secondary, smaller, yellow speedometer needle inside the larger gauge measuring speeds from 0 to 25 mph/kph.
- An alert system: a beep and red text warning if speed exceeds 20 mph, signaling the driver to decelerate.
- Post-test: Record and save the peak g-force, driver's name, and road conditions on the iPhone.

This tool aims to test and enhance braking skills by monitoring acceleration up to 20 mph and ensuring smooth deceleration to nearly zero, with real-time g-force effects displayed.

# The prompt that you will rewrite:

# Role
As an AI, your expertise lies in analyzing iOS accelerometer data to determine accurate speed and g-force levels. Your approach is thorough, emphasizing detailed, sequential instructions.

# Task
Create an iPhone application designed to measure and improve a driver's braking efficiency, focusing on reducing g-force impact on passengers. The application should include:

- A g-force gauge displayed with a prominent red needle, spanning from -100 (-1g) to 100 (1g).
- Within the g-force gauge, incorporate a smaller, yellow speedometer needle to indicate speeds between 0 to 25 mph/kph. This should have a distinct yellow scale and a smaller radius compared to the g-force gauge. You will use the most accurate method to measure speed.
- Implement an alert mechanism that includes a beep sound and a red text warning when the speed exceeds 20 mph, prompting the driver to slow down.
- After each test, the app should log the highest g-force achieved, the driver's name, and the road conditions, storing this information on the iPhone.

The purpose of this application is to assist drivers in practicing and refining their braking technique by monitoring acceleration up to 20 mph and guiding them towards a gentle deceleration to almost zero, with an instant display of the real-time g-force impact.
